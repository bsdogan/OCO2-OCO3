- **Accessing the OCO2/OCO3 Dataset:** It furnishes step-by-step instructions on how to access the OCO2/OCO3 dataset, ensuring that users can retrieve the requisite data effectively.
- **Analysis of the OCO2/OCO3 Dataset Using Python:** The tutorial goes on to elucidate the process of conducting data analysis on the OCO2/OCO3 dataset through the utilization of Python. It outlines the necessary procedures and methodologies required for this task.
- **Introductory Level:** Recognizing the diverse range of expertise among potential users, this tutorial is specifically tailored for individuals at an introductory level. It provides foundational information and avoids assuming prior knowledge, ensuring accessibility to a wider audience.
- **Visualization of a Single netCDF File:** One of the primary objectives of this tutorial is to enable users to visualize a single netCDF file within the OCO2/OCO3 dataset. It provides clear, step-by-step guidance on how to achieve this task, emphasizing comprehensibility and ease of implementation.

## NASA ARSET: A Demonstration on how to Access and Visualize OCO-2/OCO-3 Data, Part 2/4
## POWER POINT PORTION
1. Introduction to XCO2
2. What is XCO2 and history?
3. What can XCO2 show and not show
4. Plotted example of XCO2
5. Measurement Approach
6. Spatial and Temporal Resolution for OCO-2 and OCO-3
7.How do we know the data is good?
8.Where to download the data
9. Product and Naming
10.Documentation for data products

# JUPYTER NOTEBOOK PORTION
Before following along, you will need to download software packages for this portion of the training. This is also what you will need in order to work with the data. We will be working in python, please make sure to have python 3 installed as well as Jupyter Notebook installed.

Please be sure to have these libraries downloaded as well – (list libraries)

OCO-2 Data files are large so it will take some time to download!

1. Show what happens when we open up Jupyter Notebook (we will provide a path for the demo)
2. Show code for how we pull the data from the data (File name, date and geolocation)
3. Example one – XY Plot of XCO2 variation over time for a given location
4. Example two- Show same plot but over several years
5. Example three- Same location and time but shown over Google Earth for OCO-2 data
6. Example four- Same location and time but show over Google Earth for OCO-3 data
7. Example five – GIF showing OCO-3 data on spinning globe
